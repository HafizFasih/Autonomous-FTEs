## Email Content

Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well. I came across your portfolio online and was impressed by your work, particularly the e-commerce projects you've completed.

I'm the founder of a startup called TechVentures, and we're looking to build a new web application for our business. The project would include:

- A modern, responsive website
- User authentication and profiles
- Dashboard for business analytics
- Payment processing integration
- Mobile-friendly design

Our timeline is flexible, but we'd like to launch by the end of Q1 2026.

Could you provide:
1. Your availability for a project of this scope
2. Rough estimate of timeline and cost
3. Examples of similar projects you've done

I'd love to schedule a call to discuss this in more detail. Are you available sometime next week?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
John Doe
Founder, TechVentures
