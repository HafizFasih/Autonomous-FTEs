## Lessons from Branch 4

### What Worked Well
1. **Comprehensive documentation first:** Made testing and submission easier
2. **Structured testing approach:** Systematic validation caught issues early
3. **Clear checklists:** PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST prevents missed steps
4. **Demo script preparation:** Makes video recording straightforward

### What We'd Improve
1. **Earlier testing:** Should have tested more during development
2. **Parallel docs:** Writing docs after code delayed completion
3. **Video preparation:** Could have recorded demos during testing

### Key Insights
- **Documentation is investment:** Saves time during submission
- **Checklists prevent errors:** Systematic approach = fewer mistakes
- **Testing early matters:** Catch issues before they compound
- **Polish counts:** Professional documentation impresses judges
